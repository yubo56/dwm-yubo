### About

This is a completely rekt copy of the dwm-git aur repo that should have a
merge-base somewhere around tag 6.0.2. I've gone in and tweaked the source in a
few odd places and changed the config.h keybindings significantly. If they seem
incomprehensible, I use the Dvorak keyboard layout and have a really janky
workflow.
